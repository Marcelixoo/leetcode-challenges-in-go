# LeetCode Challenges In Go

This is part of my studies on the [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/).

The repository is structured in such a way that each challenge is a separate package,
while the main module simply displays a list of them with links to the platform.

## Installation
```shell
go get ./...
```

## Testing
```shell
go test ./...
```
